# Conti Chat Scripts
Quick Scripts that translate and parse the leaked Conti chat logs from VX-Underground. 

They're nothing special, just thought i'd share in case someone else was interesting in looking at the logs. 

Currently, the general chat script is available, I will be uploading the rocketchat and jabber ones soon. 

## Requirements
- `translate-shell`
- `jq`
